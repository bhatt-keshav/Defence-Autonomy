- Approach: From macro (outlining the problems) to micro (drones/ai). Supplemented by a system dynamics model
- What signposts to look out for
- What to do in the meantime till there is no clarity i.e. in this period of volatility?
- What does it mean for asset managers?
- The short term volatility for at least three years that will be present till we do not have stability in defence production and self-sustainability what are the
  - opportunities :
    - drone and AI
    - parts of the defence value chain that can be reformed
    - opportunities in other supply chain that can be repurposed
    - 3 d printing
  - risks:
    - NATO defence review is to take place which will take a couple of years
    - Cybersecurity, civilian infra, physical assets instead of traditional battle attacks that we are accustomed to
    - Lack of policy clarity on the market over 5-10 years
- Inadequate supply of critical raw and rare earth materials (feed-stock) which is also becoming expensive because of sudden rise in demand
  - China holds monopoly (?) on not only the mining but also the refining of rare-earth materials
  - Catch-22, because of the transatlantic history, EU has been aligned with USA. It might get caught in the crosshairs China or USA whichever side it chooses
- EU integration of
  - common procurement (how?)
  - Nationalism is a spanner in the works
    - German model which builds factories in multiple countries compared to French model which keeps all production within its borders. The former leads to more consensus and greater participation while the latter leads to more efficiency
  - Cooperation of countries to become specialists in what they can supply
- How to fund this?
  - Smaller countries will have to cut the share of the welfare spending if such high defence spending needs to be finance especially if they have high debt and defecits eg Belgium
  - joint borrowing (strained by high indebtedness of countries like France and Italy)
  - vetoing by Russian aligned states like Hungary can prevent issuance of common debt that could solve this
  - will cause yields to widen in countries with less strong economies
- Transatlantic trade:
  - How to react to American defence goods which have a competitive element
  - How much dependency will remain on USA
  - Lesser funding made available by Trump to traditional defence companies, which is risky because they won’t be able to innovate but can be an opportunity as Europeans might be able to get cheaper equipment.
- What are the right defence equipment that the continent needs and what do smaller countries need/can supply.
  - e.g. Netherlands
- Geopolitical risks
- Till now defence investment has been taboo in EU with a focus on ESG investing especially in countries like the Netherlands. Still no policy clarity if investing in defence is ok. What about public perception of people opposed to this but also of parties like die Linke in Germany that are against defence spending. Strong but mixed sentiment.
# Abstract

**European Defence Autonomy in Flux: Implications for Markets and Asset Managers**

The re-election of Donald Trump introduces new geopolitical dynamics for Europe, with defence relations between transatlantic partners playing a crucial role. While strategic autonomy has gained prominence, Europe still lacks a cohesive industrial base, regulatory framework, and feedstock to support effective and sustainable rearmament. This uncertain and fragmented environment is expected to persist in the short term, posing a dilemma for institutional investors regarding whether rising defence spending will yield effective outcomes. This study focuses on the implications for traditionally pacifist, free-market economies such as the Netherlands during this period of uncertainty.

This research maps the path from macro-level geopolitical challenges-namely defence decoupling, supply chain fragility, and fiscal constraints-to micro-level opportunities including drone warfare, cybersecurity, and ESG realignments. Additionally, we aim to develop a system dynamics model to simulate possible outcomes amid this volatility. These simulations aim to assist asset managers in identifying key indicators to navigate decision-making challenges during this period of geopolitical transformation.

- Combine model with a conceptual framework #todo
	- 4 boxes model?
	- 60-40?
- Make the model simpler
	- Do not model Debt-GDP 
	- Do not model anything that a rating agency would do for instance sovereign credit research
	- Something an economist would do, but not an economist at IMF or Oxford Economics.
	- Should be like a more thought about back of the envelope calculation
- Focus group:
	- (Private) Equity investors
	- ~~Fixed income investors~~ ❌
- Model the defence sector as one company instead of multiple companies
	- the Franco-German motor is one company
	- take a single company to be representative of the entire sector
	- aggregation becomes semi-representative of defence companies across the EU
	- e.g. BAE, Rheinmettal
- Use top-down analysis 
	- tie calculations to some economic variable
	- current inventory will be secret, so look at the income statement of a representative company to find out the linkages between sales v/s increased demand
	- you can use macro-economic variables as proxy for variables like demand
	- tax-breaks related to debt service coverage ratio (DSC) #unclear 
- Of course we need to think about input v/s output
- Timelines: 3-5 years
- Perspective that comes from the model:
	- does an opportunity lie in this sector?
	- what does the market/model think? Is it overpriced/underpriced/suitably priced
- Profitability comes through growing sales or growing margins (via tax-breaks) #unclear

* Vlad has a back of the envelope calculation for calculating the size of the defence industry
* #todo make a web-app so that users can play with the external variable and determine the valuations themselves
* Vlad has a ppt which talks about the opportunity space on 
	* macro level
	* sector level
* Germany
	* what will be the nominal growth after x years of Germany?
	* Germany's growth has been stagnant
	* can we use a fiscal multiplier of 0.5-1?
	* due to defence spending by Germany, spreads will increase with other South European countries after reaching convergence finally
* For metals cost use some external projections already existing
* How to model geopolitical risk?
	* Expert opinion?
* Parochialism
	* Tough to model
	* Use rise in right-wing populism as proxy? Anti-EU sentiment
* Replace FCF with earnings and avoid the FCF loop
* Pro-US purchases -> sales down -> R&D down -> productivity down
