# Defence-Autonomy
The re-election of Donald Trump introduces new geopolitical dynamics for Europe, with defence relations between transatlantic partners playing a crucial role. While strategic autonomy has gained prominence, Europe still lacks a cohesive industrial base, regulatory framework, and feedstock to support effective and sustainable rearmament. This uncertain and fragmented environment is expected to persist in the short term, posing a dilemma for institutional investors regarding whether rising defence spending will yield effective outcomes. This study focuses on the implications for traditionally pacifist, free-market economies such as the Netherlands during this period of uncertainty.

This research maps the path from macro-level geopolitical challenges-namely defence decoupling, supply chain fragility, and fiscal constraints-to micro-level opportunities including drone warfare, cybersecurity, and ESG realignments. Additionally, we aim to develop a system dynamics model to simulate possible outcomes amid this volatility. These simulations aim to assist asset managers in identifying key indicators to navigate decision-making challenges during this period of geopolitical transformation.
